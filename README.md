# üõ°Ô∏è Caddy WAF Middleware

A robust and flexible **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** middleware for the Caddy web server, designed to provide **comprehensive protection** against a wide array of web-based attacks. This middleware integrates seamlessly with Caddy and offers a rich set of security features to safeguard your applications.

[![Go](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/actions/workflows/go.yml) [![CodeQL](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql) [![Build and test Caddy with WAF](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/actions/workflows/build.yml) 

## üåü Key Features

*   **Rule-Based Filtering:** Flexible rule engine using regular expressions to inspect request components such as URL, arguments, body, headers, and cookies.
*   **IP and DNS Blacklisting:** Block malicious traffic using IP address and DNS domain blacklists. Supports both single IPs and CIDR ranges in the IP blacklist.
*   **Country-Based Blocking/Whitelisting:** Control access based on the geographic location of the client using MaxMind GeoIP2 databases.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect against brute-force attacks and abusive behavior by setting limits on requests per IP address.
*   **Anomaly Scoring System:** Detect suspicious activity by assigning scores to rule matches, triggering actions when a threshold is exceeded.
*   **Multi-Phase Inspection:** Rules are evaluated across multiple request/response phases, offering in-depth traffic analysis.
*   **Customizable Block Responses:** Customize block responses with custom status codes, headers, and body content, including static files.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive logging of WAF activities with configurable severity levels (debug, info, warn, error) and JSON format options.
*   **Dynamic Configuration Reloading:** Changes to rules, blacklists, and most other configurations are applied without restarting Caddy, using file watchers.
*   **Request Redaction:** Option to redact sensitive data in logs such as password, token, and API keys found in query parameters.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Ensures that all resources like database connections and rate limiter are closed gracefully.
*   **GeoIP Lookup Fallback**: Configurable behavior when GeoIP lookup fails, allowing for default allow, deny, or specific country code fallback.

## üìú Rules Format (`rules.json`)

Rules are defined in a JSON file as an array of objects. Each rule specifies how to match a pattern, what parts of the request to inspect, and what action to take when a match is found.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "wordpress-brute-force",
        "phase": 2,
        "pattern": "(?i)(?:wp-login\\.php|xmlrpc\\.php).*?(?:username=|pwd=)",
        "targets": ["URI", "ARGS"],
        "severity": "HIGH",
         "action": "block",
        "score": 8,
        "description": "Block brute force attempts targeting WordPress login and XML-RPC endpoints."
    },
     {
        "id": "sql-injection-header",
        "phase": 1,
        "pattern": "(?i)(?:select|insert|update|delete|union|drop|--|;)",
        "targets": ["HEADERS:X-Attack"],
        "severity": "CRITICAL",
        "action": "block",
        "score": 10,
        "description": "Detect and block SQL injection attempts in custom header."
    },
     {
        "id": "log4j-jndi",
         "phase": 2,
        "pattern": "(?i)\\$\\{jndi:(ldap|rmi|dns):\\/\\/.*\\}",
        "targets": ["BODY","ARGS","URI","HEADERS"],
       "severity": "CRITICAL",
        "action": "block",
        "score": 10,
        "description":"Detect Log4j vulnerability attempts"
     }

]
```

### Rule Fields

| Field        | Description                                                                           | Example                                |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `id`         | Unique identifier for the rule.                                                      | `sql_injection_1`                      |
| `phase`      | Processing phase (1: Request Headers, 2: Request Body, 3: Response Headers, 4: Response Body).| `2`                                    |
| `pattern`    | Regular expression to match malicious patterns.                                      | `(?i)(?:select|insert|update)`        |
| `targets`    | Array of request parts to inspect, which can be: `URI`, `ARGS`, `BODY`, `HEADERS`, `COOKIES`, `HEADERS:<header_name>`,  `RESPONSE_HEADERS`, `RESPONSE_BODY`, `RESPONSE_HEADERS:<header_name>`, or `COOKIES:<cookie_name>`.| `["ARGS", "BODY"]`                     |
| `severity`   | Severity of the rule (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`).  Used only for logging.        | `CRITICAL`                             |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Attack Types

1.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Detects attempts to inject malicious SQL code.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Protects against injection of malicious scripts.
3.  **Path Traversal:** Blocks access to restricted files/directories.
4.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Detects attempts to execute arbitrary commands.
5.  **Log4j Exploits:** Identifies and blocks Log4j related attack patterns.
6.  **Protocol Attacks:** Protects against access to sensitive protocol or configuration files.
7.  **Scanner Detection:** Identifies known vulnerability scanners.

---

## üö´ Blacklist Formats

### IP Blacklist (`ip_blacklist.txt`)

*   Supports single IP addresses, CIDR ranges, and comments (lines starting with `#`).

```text
192.168.1.1
10.0.0.0/8
2001:db8::/32
# This is a comment
```

### DNS Blacklist (`dns_blacklist.txt`)

*   Contains one domain per line (comments are allowed with `#`).
*   All entries are lowercased before matching.

```text
malicious.com
evil.example.org
# This is a comment
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limiting

Configure rate limits using requests count and time window, and optional cleanup interval:

```caddyfile
# 100 requests per minute with a 5 minute cleanup interval
rate_limit 100 1m 5m

# 10 requests per second with a 1 minute cleanup interval
rate_limit 10 1s 1m

# 1000 requests per hour with a 5 minute cleanup interval
rate_limit 1000 1h 5m
```

*   The rate limiter is based on the client IP address.
* The cleanup interval controls how frequently the rate limiter clears expired entries from memory.
*   When the requests count is greater than the specified value for the defined period, then the request will be blocked.

---

## üåç Country Blocking and Whitelisting

*   Uses the MaxMind GeoIP2 database for country lookups.
*   Download the `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` file (see [Installation](#-installation)).
*   Use `block_countries` or `whitelist_countries` with ISO country codes:

```caddyfile
# Block requests from Russia, China, and North Korea
block_countries /path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb RU CN KP

# Whitelist requests from the United States
whitelist_countries /path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb US
```

*   **Note:** Only one of `block_countries` or `whitelist_countries` can be enabled at a time.
*   When GeoIP lookup fails, the fallback behavior is configurable using the `WithGeoIPLookupFallbackBehavior` option when instantiating the middleware. Default behavior is to log and treat the lookup as not in the list. Options are `none` to block if the lookup fails or a specific country code to fallback to. For example, setting it to `US` will allow requests from IPs if the GeoIP lookup fails and `US` was in the list of allowed countries.

---

## üîÑ Dynamic Updates

*   Most changes to the configuration (rules, blacklists, etc) can be applied without restarting Caddy.
*   File watchers monitor the changes on your rules and blacklist files and trigger the automatic reload.
*   Simply modify the related files and the changes will be applied automatically by the file watcher.
*   To reload configurations using the Caddy API execute `caddy reload`.

---

## üß™ Testing

### Basic Testing

The included `test.sh` script sends a series of `curl` requests to test various attack scenarios:

```bash
./test.sh
```
### Load Testing

Use a tool like `ab` to perform load testing:
```bash
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/
```

### Security Testing Suite

The `test.sh` script will provide a comprehensive check if the rules configured are working. 
*   Each test will be passed or failed based on the configured WAF configuration.
*   The output log contains the result for each test along with a summary.
*   An overall percentage is given at the end, and if the percentage is less than 90% it is recommended to check the output log to analyse the cause of the failing tests.

---

## üê≥ Docker Support

Build and run a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t caddy-waf .

# Run the Docker container, mapping port 8080
docker run -p 8080:8080 caddy-waf
```

---

## üêç Rule/Blacklist Population Scripts

Scripts to generate/download rules and blacklists:

### `get_owasp_rules.py`

*   Fetches OWASP core rules and converts them to the required JSON format.

```bash
python3 get_owasp_rules.py
```

### `get_blacklisted_ip.py`

*   Downloads IPs from several external sources.

```bash
python3 get_blacklisted_ip.py
```

### `get_blacklisted_dns.py`

*   Downloads blacklisted domains from various sources.

```bash
python3 get_blacklisted_dns.py
```

# üåê Combining Caddy Modules for Enhanced Security

You can chain **caddy-waf**, **caddy-mib**, and **caddy-adf** to create a multi-layered security solution:

| Module       | Role in the Chain                                                                                           | Repository Link                                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **caddy-waf** | Acts as the first gate, inspecting and filtering malicious requests based on anomaly scores, rate limits, and blacklists. | [GitHub: caddy-waf](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf) |
| **caddy-mib** | Handles IP banning for repeated errors, such as 404 or 500, to prevent brute force or abusive access attempts. | [GitHub: caddy-mib](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mib) |
| **caddy-adf** | Provides an additional layer of protection by analyzing request attributes and marking/blocking suspicious traffic based on anomaly thresholds. | [GitHub: caddy-mlf](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mlf) |

Here‚Äôs an example configuration to chain the modules: 

### Flow:
1. **caddy-waf**: Listens on `localhost:8080` and forwards requests to **caddy-mib**.
2. **caddy-mib**: Listens on `localhost:8081` and forwards requests to **caddy-mlf**.
3. **caddy-adf**: Listens on `localhost:8082` and returns a `200 OK` response for legitimate requests or forwards requests to your **origin applications**.
