## üõ°Ô∏è Core Protections

*   **Regex-Based Filtering:** Deep URL, data & header inspection using powerful regex rules.
*   **Blacklisting:** Blocks malicious IPs, domains & optionally TOR exit nodes.
*  **Geo-Blocking:** Restricts access by country using GeoIP.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse via customizable IP request limits.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Dynamically blocks requests based on cumulative rule matches.
*   **Multi-Phase Inspection:** Analyzes traffic throughout the request lifecycle.
*   **Sensitive Data Redaction:** Removes private info from logs.
*   **Custom Response Handling:** Tailored responses for blocked requests.
*   **Detailed Monitoring:** JSON endpoint for performance tracking & analysis.
*   **Dynamic Config Reloads:** Seamless updates without restarts.
*   **File Watchers:** Automatic reloads on rule/blacklist changes.
*   **Wide-Ranging Attack Detection:** [ *Implied, but consider a few common types if desired e.g., SQLi, XSS, etc.*]


## üöÄ Quick Start

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the caddy-waf repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf.git

# Step 2: Navigate into the caddy-waf directory
cd caddy-waf

# Step 3: Clean up and update the go.mod file
go mod tidy

# Step 4: Fetch and install the required Go modules
go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2
go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2/caddyconfig/caddyfile
go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2/caddyconfig/httpcaddyfile
go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2/modules/caddyhttp
go get github.com/oschwald/maxminddb-golang
go get github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify
go get -v github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf
go mod tidy

# Step 5: Download the GeoLite2 Country database (required for country blocking/whitelisting)
wget https://git.io/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb

# Step 6: Build Caddy with the caddy-waf module
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf=./

# Step 7: Fix Caddyfile format
caddy fmt --overwrite

# Step 8: Run the compiled Caddy server

```

### Final Notes

*   Ensure your Go environment is properly configured and that you are using a compatible version of Go as specified in the `go.mod` file.
*   After building with `xcaddy`, verify the `http.handlers.waf` module by running `./caddy list-modules`.
*   The `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` needs to be in the same directory as `caddy` or a correct path should be passed to the `block_countries` or `whitelist_countries` configuration parameter.

## üìú Rules Format (`rules.json`)

Rules are defined in a JSON file as an array of objects. Each rule specifies how to match a pattern, what parts of the request to inspect, and what action to take when a match is found.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "wordpress-brute-force",
        "phase": 2,
        "pattern": "(?i)(?:wp-login\\.php|xmlrpc\\.php).*?(?:username=|pwd=)",
        "targets": ["URI", "ARGS"],
        "severity": "HIGH",
         "action": "block",
        "score": 8,
        "description": "Block brute force attempts targeting WordPress login and XML-RPC endpoints."
    },
     {
        "id": "sql-injection-header",
        "phase": 1,
        "pattern": "(?i)(?:select|insert|update|delete|union|drop|--|;)",
        "targets": ["HEADERS:X-Attack"],
        "severity": "CRITICAL",
        "action": "block",
        "score": 10,
        "description": "Detect and block SQL injection attempts in custom header."
    },
     {
        "id": "log4j-jndi",
         "phase": 2,
        "pattern": "(?i)\\$\\{jndi:(ldap|rmi|dns):\\/\\/.*\\}",

### Rules Metrics

You can gain insights into your WAF's behavior, optimize your ruleset, and monitor your traffic by inspecting the metrics endpoint or processing such stats with other tools. This endpoint provides detailed information about requests, rule hits, and GeoIP statistics.

```
caddy-waf % curl -fsSL http://localhost:8080/waf_metrics | jq .
{
  "allowed_requests": 1209,
  "blocked_requests": 6275,
  "geoip_stats": {},

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Attack Types

1.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Detects and blocks attempts to inject malicious SQL code.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Protects against the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
3.  **Path Traversal:** Blocks access to restricted files and directories through directory traversal techniques.
4.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Detects and prevents attempts to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
5.  **Log4j Exploits:** Identifies and blocks Log4j vulnerability related attack patterns.
6.  **Protocol Attacks:** Protects against attacks targeting sensitive protocol or configuration files.
7.  **Scanner Detection:** Detects and blocks requests originating from known vulnerability scanners.
8.  **Header & Cookie Injection:** Detects and blocks malicious content injected via headers and cookies.
9.  **Insecure Deserialization:** Blocks requests with potentially malicious serialized data.
10. **HTTP Request Smuggling:** Prevents attacks that bypass security devices using inconsistent header combinations.
11. **HTTP Response Splitting:** Blocks attempts to inject malicious code through header manipulation.
12. **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Detects attempts to access resources using predictable object IDs.
13. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Prevents attacks that make the server perform unauthorized requests.
14. **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** Blocks attacks leveraging XML external entity processing.
15. **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Prevents code injection through template engines.
16. **Mass Assignment:** Blocks unauthorized modification of object attributes through uncontrolled input.
17. **NoSQL Injection:** Prevents malicious NoSQL queries designed to bypass authentication or steal data.
18.  **XPath Injection:** Blocks attempts to manipulate XML documents with malicious XPath queries.
19. **LDAP Injection:** Detects and prevents the injection of malicious data into LDAP queries.
20. **XML Injection:** Detects various attacks exploiting XML manipulation.
21. **File Upload:** Blocks malicious file uploads to prevent execution of unwanted code.
22. **JWT Attacks:** Detects JWT tampering attempts and bypasses.
23. **GraphQL Injection:** Blocks attempts to perform unauthorized operations or extract data via GraphQL queries.
24. **Clickjacking:** Mitigates clickjacking attempts by preventing rendering the protected content inside a frame.
25.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Blocks CSRF attacks by preventing unauthorized requests from being performed.

## üö´ Blacklist Formats

### IP Blacklist (`ip_blacklist.txt`)

*   Supports single IP addresses, CIDR ranges, and comments (lines starting with `#`).

```text
192.168.1.1
10.0.0.0/8
2001:db8::/32
# This is a comment
```

### DNS Blacklist (`dns_blacklist.txt`)

*   Contains one domain per line (comments are allowed with `#`).
*   All entries are lowercased before matching.

```text
malicious.com
evil.example.org
# This is a comment
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limiting

Configure rate limits using requests count, time window, optional cleanup interval and specific paths. You can use exact paths or regex patterns for greater flexibility. You can specify to which path to apply rate limiting using the parameter `match_all_paths`, if true only matching paths will be rate limited, otherwise all paths except the matching will be rate limited:

```caddyfile
rate_limit {
    requests 100
    window 10s
    cleanup_interval 5m
    paths /api/v1/.* /admin/.*   # List of regex patterns
    match_all_paths false    # When `true` it will apply only to the specified paths, `false` will rate limit all paths
}
```

*   The rate limiter is based on the client IP address.
*   The cleanup interval controls how frequently the rate limiter clears expired entries from memory.
*   When the requests count is greater than the specified value for the defined period, the request will be blocked.
*   Use `paths` to specify regex patterns or paths for selective rate limiting. If `match_all_paths` is set to `false`, only the specified paths will be rate-limited. If `match_all_paths` is set to `true`, all paths *except* those specified will be rate-limited.

## üåç Country Blocking and Whitelisting

*   Uses the MaxMind GeoIP2 database for country lookups.
*   Download the `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` file (see [Installation](#-installation)).
*   Use `block_countries` or `whitelist_countries` with ISO country codes:

```caddyfile
# Block requests from Russia, China, and North Korea
block_countries /path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb RU CN KP

# Whitelist requests from the United States
whitelist_countries /path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb US
```

*   **Note:** Only one of `block_countries` or `whitelist_countries` can be enabled at a time.

### GeoIP Lookup Fallback

When GeoIP lookup fails, the fallback behavior is configurable using the `WithGeoIPLookupFallbackBehavior` option when instantiating the middleware. Default behavior is to log and treat the lookup as not in the list. Options are `none` to block if the lookup fails or a specific country code to fallback to. For example, setting it to `US` will allow requests from IPs if the GeoIP lookup fails and `US` was in the list of allowed countries.

## üîÑ Dynamic Updates

*   Most changes to the configuration (rules, blacklists, etc) can be applied without restarting Caddy.
*   File watchers monitor the changes on your rules and blacklist files and trigger the automatic reload.
*   Simply modify the related files and the changes will be applied automatically by the file watcher.
*   To reload configurations using the Caddy API execute `caddy reload`.

## üß™ Testing

### Basic Testing

The included `test.sh` script sends a series of `curl` requests to test various attack scenarios:

```bash
./test.sh
```

### Load Testing

Use a tool like `ab` to perform load testing:

```bash
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/
```

### Security Testing Suite

The `test.py` script provides a comprehensive check to verify the effectiveness of the configured WAF rules.

*   Each test case will result in either a pass or a fail, based on the rules configured in the WAF.
*   The output log contains detailed results for each test case, along with a summary of all tests performed.
*   An overall percentage is reported at the end, and if the percentage is below 90%, it's recommended to review the output log for further analysis of the failing tests.
*   The security testing suite will test SQL Injection, XSS, Path Traversal, RCE, and much more. You can find a list of tested attacks in the `test.py` script.
*   To run the security testing suite:

```bash
python3 test.py
```
