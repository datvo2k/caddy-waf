# ⚙️ Configuration

Understanding how the Caddy Web Application Firewall (WAF) processes incoming requests, evaluates rules, and decides when to block a request is crucial for effective configuration and management. This section explains the request lifecycle within the WAF, including the order of operations and the logic behind blocking decisions.

## **Request Processing Flow: From Caddy to the WAF**

1. **Incoming Request:**  
   When a client sends an HTTP request to your Caddy server, it is first handled by Caddy's core request-handling mechanism.

2. **WAF Middleware Invoked:**  
   If a `waf` block is configured in your `Caddyfile`, the WAF middleware is invoked as the first handler in the route.

3. **Request Context Initialization:**  
   The WAF initializes a `WAFState` struct for each incoming request. This struct holds:
   - The request's anomaly score (`TotalScore`).
   - Its blocking status (`Blocked`).
   - The response status code (`StatusCode`).
   - A unique log identifier for tracing the request in logs.

4. **Phase-Based Evaluation:**  
   The WAF processes the request in distinct phases, each representing a specific stage of the request lifecycle. Phases are executed in numerical order:

   - **Phase 1: Request Headers (and Early Checks)**  
     This phase occurs before the request body is parsed and includes:
     - **Country Blocking/Whitelisting (Optional):**  
       Checks the request's source IP against a configured country list. If the IP originates from a blocked country (or not from a whitelisted country), the request is immediately blocked.
     - **Rate Limiting (Optional):**  
       Checks the rate limiter against the client IP and request path. If the request count exceeds the limit within the configured time window, the request is blocked.
     - **IP Blacklisting:**  
       Checks the request's source IP against the configured IP blacklist. If a match is found (direct IP or CIDR range), the request is blocked.
     - **DNS Blacklisting:**  
       Checks the request's `Host` header against the DNS blacklist. If a match is found, the request is blocked.
     - **Rule Evaluation for Request Headers:**  
       Checks the request headers against the configured rules for Phase 1.

   - **Phase 2: Request Body:**  
     Analyzes the request body against rules configured for this phase, looking for malicious payloads.

   - **Phase 3: Response Headers:**  
     After the request is processed by the backend, the WAF analyzes the response headers before sending them to the client, looking for malicious payloads or unintended information.

   - **Phase 4: Response Body:**  
     After the response is processed by the backend, the WAF analyzes the response body before sending it to the client, looking for malicious or unintended content.

5. **Rule Evaluation within Each Phase:**  
   - For each phase, the WAF iterates through the rules defined for that phase, respecting their order and priority.
   - For each rule, the WAF extracts the configured `target` (e.g., URL, headers, body, cookies) from the request (or response in Phases 3 and 4).
   - The extracted value is matched against the rule's regular expression (`pattern`).
   - If a match is found:
     - The rule's hit count is incremented.
     - The rule's score is added to the request's `TotalScore`.
     - The WAF checks if the rule's action is `block` or if the `TotalScore` exceeds the `anomaly_threshold`.
     - If either condition is met:
       - The request is marked as `Blocked`.
       - The response status code is set to `403 Forbidden` (customizable).
       - A `WARN` log entry is created with details about the blocked request.
       - If a custom response is defined, it is sent to the client.
       - Request processing stops immediately, and no further WAF rules or handlers are executed.
     - If the rule's action is `log`, the match is logged at `INFO` level, and the request continues processing.

6. **Request Continues or Blocked:**  
   - If the request is not `Blocked`, it proceeds to the next handler on the route (e.g., your application's handler).
   - If the request is `Blocked`, a `403` error (or custom response) is returned to the client, and no further handlers are executed.

7. **Metrics Collection:**  
   For every request processed, the WAF updates internal counters:
   - `total_requests`: Incremented for all requests.
   - `blocked_requests`: Incremented if the request is blocked.
   - `allowed_requests`: Incremented if the request is allowed.

8. **Metrics Exposure:**  
   A `/waf_metrics` endpoint provides a JSON output of these metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting, offering insights into WAF activity.

## **Blocking Logic and Precedence**

- **Early Checks Take Precedence:**  
  Country blocking/whitelisting, rate limiting, IP blacklisting, and DNS blacklisting in Phase 1 take precedence over rule-based checks. If a request is blocked by any of these, further rule evaluations are skipped.

- **Rule Priority:**  
  Within each phase, rules are evaluated in the order they appear in the configuration file, with higher priority rules evaluated first.

- **Anomaly Scoring:**  
  The `anomaly_threshold` blocks requests that trigger multiple lower-severity rules by accumulating their scores.

- **Rule Action `block`:**  
  If a rule has the `block` action, the request is immediately blocked, regardless of the `anomaly_threshold` or other rules.

- **First Match Blocks (with Exception):**  
  If a rule matches and the request is blocked, processing stops immediately, except for rules with the `log` action, which only log the match and continue processing.

- **Custom Responses:**  
  Custom responses for blocked requests take precedence over the default blocking message.

- **Short Circuiting:**  
  If a request is blocked, processing stops immediately, saving resources and ensuring a fast response.

- **Response Processing:**  
  In Phases 3 and 4, the WAF evaluates the response being sent to the client. If the response is blocked, the configured custom response is returned instead.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Ordered Processing:**  
  The WAF processes requests in a specific order, ensuring higher-priority checks are performed first.

- **Flexible Blocking:**  
  Requests can be blocked based on explicit rules, anomaly scores, country restrictions, rate limits, blacklists, or a combination of factors.

- **Customizable Behavior:**  
  The WAF is highly customizable through configuration options, allowing adaptation to specific security needs.

- **Efficient Handling:**  
  Short-circuiting ensures that once a request is blocked, no further processing is performed, improving performance.

- **Response Evaluation:**  
  The WAF evaluates responses and blocks them if necessary, ensuring only safe content is sent to the client.

## **Important Considerations**

- **Mutual Exclusivity:**  
  Some options, like `block_countries` and `whitelist_countries`, are mutually exclusive and cannot be used simultaneously.

- **File Paths:**  
  Ensure the WAF process has the correct permissions to read and write to specified file paths.

- **Option Precedence:**  
  Some configurations take precedence over others. For example, rate limiting may be overridden by a rule that blocks a request.

- **Validation:**  
  Test the configuration and review errors during startup to ensure validity.

- **Defaults:**  
  Be aware of default parameter values to ensure they meet your requirements.

- **Logging:**  
  Use logging to troubleshoot configuration issues.

- **Security:**  
  Secure access to configuration and log files to prevent unauthorized modifications.

- **Dynamic Changes:**  
  Most configuration changes require restarting the service to take effect.

By carefully configuring these options, you can tailor the WAF's behavior to meet your specific security requirements, balancing protection with performance. Thorough testing after making changes is essential to ensure the WAF operates as expected. This fine-grained control ensures the WAF serves as an effective security layer for your web application.
