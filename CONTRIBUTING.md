# Contribute to the caddy-waf project!

You can contribute in many ways:

1. Testing the solution in different contexts and provide useful feedback.
2. Writing WAF rules and submitting a PR. Contribution rules must be saved to the `rules` folder.
3. Improving the documentation.
4. Opening an issue.
5. Improving the whole codebase, if something really big please provide additional context.

You already know the right way to submit a PR :)

- Clone the repository locally.
- Create a dedicated feature branch for your changes.
- Ensure your Pull Request (PR) passes all existing tests before submission.

Please note:  I am actively developing and adding more tests to ensure comprehensive coverage.  Your PR must pass the current test suite.  Thank you for your contributions!
